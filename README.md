This document has an executable, warm-started MPC-PD MATLAB code. The hardware setup used is the Quanser Qube Servo-2 pendulum platform. Inside this document, the MPC function (named as Hardware_fn) has been developed to be directly used during the hardware interface.

This repository contains all files required to reproduce the hardware results presented in the article.

Requirements: Matlab 2021a, Quanser Qube Servo-2 pendulum platform
THe results in Fig. 5-7 and Table II can be reproduced using these codes.
